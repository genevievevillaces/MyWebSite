<h2>   Hello everyone my name is Genevieve F. Villaces, but they prefered to call me ebeb or beb for short, i'm 21 years old. I am currently studying in Negros Oriental State University Guihulngan Campus 3rd year level taking Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. My parents are both farmers, I am 2nd to the last member in the family out of 6 siblings. I live in Brgy, Lumapao, Canlaon City Negros Oriental. I am a kind, hardworking, friendly, loving, caring and generous person. My hobbies are cooking, eating, reading, surfing on internet and watching movies. I also love traveling, taking pictures,posting videos in Tiktok and etc. My goal in life is to explore, learn a lot of things about technology to enhance my knowledge and skills and also I want to finish my studies to have a stable job or a better career someday. I always valued education because I know in myself that it is the best weapon to fight against poverty. And I will do my best to achieve my goals to have a better future.</h2>
